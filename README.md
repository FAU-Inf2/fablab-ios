# fablab-ios

Before building the project, you have to set up Carthage!

Setup Carthage:
--
-   Install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage)
-   Run `carthage bootstrap`

Update dependencies:
--
-   Run `carthage update`

Adding a new dependency:
--
-   https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios
-   (in step 1 just edit the Cartfile, in step 4 skip the "Create a Run Script" part and only add the paths to the frameworks)
